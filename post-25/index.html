      <p>
        For centuries, humans have stared at their pets and confidently guessed what they were thinking.
        “He’s hungry.” “She’s mad.” “That was definitely a judgmental meow.”
        Now AI would like to step in and inform us that we were probably wrong.
        From sperm whales off the coast of California to your mildly annoyed house cat,
        machine learning is being trained to decode animal communication —
        not metaphorically, but literally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Project CETI, a serious research effort involving scientists from MIT, Harvard,
        UC Berkeley, and Google, is using neural networks to analyze thousands of hours of sperm whale “codas” —
        structured click patterns believed to carry social meaning.
        The models have identified repeatable patterns and even generated new whale-like clicks
        that wild whales responded to.
        We have officially entered the era where AI might text a whale before you do.

      <p>
        Closer to home, you can now download an app that claims to translate your cat.
        MeowTalk — with over 20 million downloads and hundreds of millions of recorded meows —
        uses machine learning trained on veterinarian-labeled vocalizations
        to classify 11 different “meow intents.”
        Hunger. Loneliness. Contentment. Possibly “why are you filming me again?”
        The system analyzes sound patterns and maps them to emotional states,
        meaning your phone is now the official interpreter between you and your cat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Is it perfect? No.
        Is it fascinating that we’ve reached a point where AI isn’t just replacing spreadsheets,
        but attempting to decode whales and house pets?
        Absolutely.
        For the first time, AI isn’t just automating human tasks —
        it’s extending human perception beyond our biological limits.
        The real question isn’t whether your cat can talk.
        It’s whether you’re ready to hear what it has to say.
