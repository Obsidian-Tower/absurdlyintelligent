          HEKA’s AI mattress adjusts different zones as you sleep to reduce pressure points and keep your body supported.
          It’s like your bed is quietly negotiating with gravity all night — and somehow that’s considered normal now.

          GLYDE is a “smart” clipper system that guides beginners through a haircut using a headband start line and an auto-adjusting blade.
          No price yet, but if it lands in the few-hundred range, it might finally make DIY haircuts a real thing (without the hat phase).

          The Shazam Band is an AI-powered collar that gives your pet a human voice, plus optional GPS tracking and danger alerts.
          It’s $495–$595, and it finally answers the question: what if your dog could talk… nonstop?

          NINU is a smart perfume device that mixes three base scents in different ratios, letting an app decide how you
          should smell for work, dates, or whatever mood you’re in. Because choosing a fragrance was apparently too much pressure.

          Glüxkind built a smart stroller with powered push assist and automatic braking, so hills stop being a workout.
          It can even do a little “hands-free” mode (when empty), because of course the stroller has autonomy now.

          Remember the cat pain detector and the human toilet camera? Now it’s all packaged into a cat box.
          Purobot Ultra snaps stool and clump pics after each cleaning and flags potential issues in the app. Yes, this is real.
