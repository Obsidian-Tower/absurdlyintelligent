          If you Google “AI toothbrush” you’ll meet two finalists: the Oral-B Genius X (polite AI) and the Feno Smartbrush
          (a mouthguard pressure washer). Both want to live inside your skull. Do we allow it?

          CatsMe claims it can detect feline pain from a single photo by analyzing whiskers, ears, and eyelids. It says it’s
          90–95% accurate… while also admitting it needs more accuracy. Is this useful, or just the start of cat diagnostics as a service?

          Shift Robotics built powered shoes with wheels on the bottom, so you still walk normally… just faster than nature intended.
          No controller — to speed up, walk faster. To slow down, walk slower. The future is here and it really wants you to pass people.

          HEKA’s AI mattress adjusts different zones as you sleep to reduce pressure points and keep your body supported.
          It’s like your bed is quietly negotiating with gravity all night — and somehow that’s considered normal now.

        <div class="post-desc">
          GLYDE is a “smart” clipper system that guides beginners through a haircut using a headband start line and an auto-adjusting blade.
          No price yet, but if it lands in the few-hundred range, it might finally make DIY haircuts a real thing (without the hat phase).

          FrontierX unveiled Vex, a little autonomous sphere that follows your cat around all day filming from their perspective,
          then uses AI to edit the footage into daily highlight videos. They also have Aura — the human version — because obviously.
