          NINU is a smart perfume device that mixes three base scents in different ratios, letting an app decide how you
          should smell for work, dates, or whatever mood you’re in. Because choosing a fragrance was apparently too much pressure.

          Glüxkind built a smart stroller with powered push assist and automatic braking, so hills stop being a workout.
          It can even do a little “hands-free” mode (when empty), because of course the stroller has autonomy now.

          Remember the cat pain detector and the human toilet camera? Now it’s all packaged into a cat box.
          Purobot Ultra snaps stool and clump pics after each cleaning and flags potential issues in the app. Yes, this is real.
