          If you Google “AI toothbrush” you’ll meet two finalists: the Oral-B Genius X (polite AI) and the Feno Smartbrush
          (a mouthguard pressure washer). Both want to live inside your skull. Do we allow it?

          CatsMe claims it can detect feline pain from a single photo by analyzing whiskers, ears, and eyelids. It says it’s
          90–95% accurate… while also admitting it needs more accuracy. Is this useful, or just the start of cat diagnostics as a service?

          Shift Robotics built powered shoes with wheels on the bottom, so you still walk normally… just faster than nature intended.
          No controller — to speed up, walk faster. To slow down, walk slower. The future is here and it really wants you to pass people.

          HEKA’s AI mattress adjusts different zones as you sleep to reduce pressure points and keep your body supported.
          It’s like your bed is quietly negotiating with gravity all night — and somehow that’s considered normal now.

          GLYDE is a “smart” clipper system that guides beginners through a haircut using a headband start line and an auto-adjusting blade.
          No price yet, but if it lands in the few-hundred range, it might finally make DIY haircuts a real thing (without the hat phase).

          FrontierX unveiled Vex, a little autonomous sphere that follows your cat around all day filming from their perspective,
          then uses AI to edit the footage into daily highlight videos. They also have Aura — the human version — because obviously.

          The Shazam Band is an AI-powered collar that gives your pet a human voice, plus optional GPS tracking and danger alerts.
          It’s $495–$595, and it finally answers the question: what if your dog could talk… nonstop?

          NINU is a smart perfume device that mixes three base scents in different ratios, letting an app decide how you
          should smell for work, dates, or whatever mood you’re in. Because choosing a fragrance was apparently too much pressure.

          Glüxkind built a smart stroller with powered push assist and automatic braking, so hills stop being a workout.
          It can even do a little “hands-free” mode (when empty), because of course the stroller has autonomy now.

          Remember the cat pain detector and the human toilet camera? Now it’s all packaged into a cat box.
          Purobot Ultra snaps stool and clump pics after each cleaning and flags potential issues in the app. Yes, this is real.
