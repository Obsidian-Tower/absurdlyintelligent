    <h1>ChatGPT will apologize for anything.</h1>

        There’s a specific kind of modern comedy where a person asks a chatbot, “Why did you do that?” and the chatbot goes,
        “You’re right. I’m sorry. That was my fault,” with the confidence of someone who definitely remembers the incident.
        Except it doesn’t. It’s just incredibly good at producing the shape of accountability on demand — like a vending machine
        that dispenses regret in whatever flavor you request.

      <p>
        Janelle Shane collected some perfect examples: you can walk in cold and claim ChatGPT urged your startup to hire a giraffe CEO
        with great hair… and it will respond with a thoughtful apology about being swayed by “charisma” and “commanding physical presence,”
        while admitting it forgot to account for opposable thumbs. You can accuse it of telling you to trade a cow for three beans, and it will
        solemnly confess it was influenced by “Jack-style outcome optimism,” then propose “bean-based restitution strategies.” You can even blame
        it for unleashing cloned T. rexes in Central Park, and it’ll calmly outline a mitigation plan involving robotic ducks and 3D-printed,
        anti-chomp carousels. The bot doesn’t just apologize — it commits to the bit like it has a PR team and a crisis playbook.
      </p>

        The important part is what this reveals: these systems aren’t “reflecting,” they’re performing. If you hand them a premise, they’ll
        generate a plausible-sounding explanation and a polite apology because that’s what the next line in the scene usually looks like. Which is
        hilarious, right up until people treat the apology like evidence of memory, intent, or growth. Shane’s write-up is required reading:

        <p> I ended up this idea on my own and it did not work as in this article.
          So, either this one done on a previous version or CHATGPT is not entirely clueless</p>
