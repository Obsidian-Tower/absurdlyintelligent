      <p>
        We have officially entered the phase of civilization where we refuse to do anything manually, including standing near fire
        and pretending we know when meat is done. Enter the SEERGRILLS Perfecta, an “AI grill” that looks less like a backyard appliance
        and more like a desktop industrial CNC machine. It’s the kind of device you expect to engrave
        titanium parts for a spaceship, not cook a burger. But apparently this is where we’re at: the grill doesn’t just heat things,
        it wants to manage the entire emotional experience of grilling so you don’t have to flip, guess, or develop even one skill.

      <p>
        The Perfecta cooks differently than a normal grill. Instead of heat coming up from below and forcing you to babysit it,
        it uses a vertical setup with high-heat infrared cooking so food gets blasted from multiple sides at once.
        That means no constant flipping, no “which side is hotter,” and fewer moments where you stare at a steak like it’s a
        complicated math problem. You pick your doneness, the grill does its thing, and in theory you end up with consistent results,
        even if your personal cooking style is usually “vibes and prayers.”

        What this really highlights is how far we’re willing to go to automate even the parts of life that were never that hard.
        Grilling isn’t usually a struggle — it’s a simple, hands-on ritual — and the Perfecta reframes it as a precision task best
        handled by a desktop industrial machine that looks like it should be machining mithril instead of cooking dinner.
        For some people, that’s appealing: press a button, get consistent results, remove all uncertainty. For others, the appeal
        of grilling is being involved at all. Either way, it’s hard not to notice the pattern forming here: first spreadsheets,
        then driving, then choosing perfume… and now standing near fire. Watch it here:
