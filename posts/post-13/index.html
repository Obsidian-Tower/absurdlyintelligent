        We have automated the ordering of tacos. Not the cooking. Not the delivery. The part where a human says “hi, what can I get you?”
        Taco Bell rolled out AI-powered voice ordering in hundreds of U.S. drive-thrus, and in theory it’s there to make everything faster,
        smoother, and more accurate. In practice, it’s like pulling up to a talking menu that has read every training manual on customer service
        and now wants to run your life. You say “one thing,” it says “wonderful choice,” and suddenly you’re negotiating with a robot about
        beverages you never asked for.

      <p>
        To be fair, the system has processed a ton of orders successfully. The problem is that the internet doesn’t care about the two million
        normal orders. The internet cares about the moments where the AI accepts an order for <strong>18,000 cups of water</strong>, or gets stuck
        in a loop like it’s trying to upsell you into bankruptcy. And the funniest part is that none of this is “evil AI,” it’s just the usual
        modern reality: the software is doing its best, and humans are immediately stress-testing it for sport. We can’t even be trusted with a
        touchscreen soda machine. Now we have a conversational one.
      </p>

      
      <p>
        Taco Bell’s apparent takeaway is what every company eventually learns: full automation sounds cool until lunch rush shows up.
        The new vibe seems to be a hybrid approach where humans step in when things get busy, which is corporate speak for
        “AI is great until it meets real life.” And honestly, that’s the whole story of automation right now. We keep trying to remove humans
        from simple interactions, then act surprised when the results feel slightly weird. Not “the future,” exactly. More like “a beta test
        you experience while hungry.”
