        We have automated the ordering of tacos. Not the cooking. Not the delivery. Just the brief moment where a human says
        “hi, what can I get you?” Taco Bell rolled out AI-powered voice ordering in hundreds of U.S. drive-thrus with the goal
        of making that interaction faster and more consistent. You pull up, you speak, the system listens, and your order moves
        along without a person on the other end of the speaker. It’s a tiny slice of the day, but it turns out even a 30-second
        conversation about tacos becomes interesting once software is in the loop.

      <p>
        The system has processed millions of orders successfully. The problem is what happens when people realize they’re talking
        to an AI. If you’re anything like me, your brain immediately switches into testing mode. What does this thing actually
        have control over? Can you trick it into giving discounts? Can you ask it to turn the lights off in the bathroom?
        Can you have it mess with the next customer’s order, or get it to tell a joke? Naturally, the internet got there fast.
        Viral clips showed the AI accepting an order for <strong>18,000 cups of water</strong>, looping endlessly on drink prompts,
        and producing order totals that look less like dinner and more like a dare. This is exactly what happens when you give
        people a conversational system and a microphone — they will immediately explore the edges.
      </p>



      <p>
        And that’s probably the real takeaway. We’re entering the age of AI agents, and anytime software can take action on your
        behalf, people will immediately explore the boundaries of what it can be convinced to do. Fast food just happens to be a
        very public, very funny place to run that experiment. Taco Bell now seems to be shifting toward a hybrid approach where
        humans step in during busy periods, which feels less like a failure and more like a preview of how this tech actually
        settles in. Just enough AI to speed things up, and enough people around to step in
        when someone inevitably asks for 10^12 hot sauce packets.
