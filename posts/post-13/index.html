      <p>
        We have automated the ordering of tacos. Not the cooking. Not the delivery. Just the brief moment where a human says
        “hi, what can I get you?” Taco Bell rolled out AI-powered voice ordering in hundreds of U.S. drive-thrus with the goal
        of making that interaction faster and more consistent. You pull up, you speak, the system listens, and your order moves
        along without a person on the other end of the speaker. It’s a tiny slice of the day, but it turns out even a 30-second
        conversation about tacos becomes interesting once software is in the loop.

      <p>
        The system has processed millions of orders successfully. The problem is that people are people. If you’re anything like me,
        the moment you realize you’re talking to an AI, your brain switches into testing mode. What happens if I say something weird?
        Can I confuse it? Can I get it stuck? Can I order an unreasonable amount of something? Can I make it say something funny?
        The internet answered those questions quickly, with viral clips of the AI accepting an order for
        <strong>18,000 cups of water</strong>, looping endlessly on drink prompts, or generating totals that look less like a meal
        and more like a small mortgage. These aren’t edge cases — they’re the natural result of giving the public a conversational
        system and a microphone.
      </p>


      <p>
        And that’s probably the real takeaway. We’re entering the age of AI agents, and anytime software can take action on your
        behalf, people will immediately explore the boundaries of what it can be convinced to do. Fast food just happens to be a
        very public, very funny place to run that experiment. Taco Bell now seems to be shifting toward a hybrid approach where
        humans step in during busy periods, which feels less like a failure and more like a preview of how this tech actually
        settles in. Not fully automated. Not fully human. Just enough AI to speed things up, and enough people around to step in
        when someone inevitably asks for 18,000 waters.
