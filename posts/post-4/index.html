        There was a time when a mattress just sat there and accepted whatever weird shape you slept in.
        <strong>HEKA Sleep</strong> decided that wasn’t good enough. Their AI mattress actively adjusts itself
        while you sleep — changing firmness, height, and pressure distribution in real time to better support
        your body. It doesn’t just react once and stop either; it keeps adapting as you roll, shift, and slowly
        abandon every healthy sleeping position you promised yourself you’d maintain.
        If you want the official explanation, it’s here:
        <a href="https://hekasleep.com" target="_blank" style="color:var(--accent); text-decoration:none;">
          hekasleep.com
        </a>.
      </p>

      <!-- IMAGE 2 PLACEHOLDER -->
      <!-- img2.png: pressure visualization when laying on side -->
      <img class="img" src="img2.png" alt="Placeholder: pressure map of side sleeping position" loading="lazy" />

      <p>
        The mattress uses sensors and software to detect pressure points and then individually adjusts different
        zones to spread your weight more evenly. Your shoulders get support. Your hips stop complaining.
        Your spine gets a fighting chance. And yes — it can even detect snoring and gently tilt the bed to try
        and open your airway, which means your mattress has officially crossed the line from “furniture” into
        “concerned roommate.” There’s an explainer video here if you want to see it in action:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxFMDGL3Oyw" target="_blank" style="color:var(--accent); text-decoration:none;">
          youtube.com/watch?v=jxFMDGL3Oyw
        </a>.
      </p>

      <!-- img3.png: before and after pressure comparison -->
      <img class="img" src="img3.png" alt="Placeholder: before and after pressure comparison" loading="lazy" />

      <p>
        The wild part is that it never really stops adjusting. As you move during the night, the mattress
        quietly reshapes itself underneath you, redistributing pressure and minimizing stress on your body
        without waking you up. It’s like sleeping on a surface that’s constantly negotiating with gravity
        on your behalf. Is it slightly unsettling that your bed knows when you’re snoring and shifts you
        accordingly? Maybe. But if this is what it takes to wake up without feeling like you lost a fight
        with your own skeleton, the future of sleep might actually be worth it.
