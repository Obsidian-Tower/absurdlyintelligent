        We’ve gone from “please scoop my litter box” to “please analyze my cat’s bathroom behavior and tell me what it means.”
        Introducing the <strong>Purobot Ultra</strong> from PETKIT — an AI-powered automatic cat litter box that not only cleans itself,
        but also watches every visit with a swiveling camera and keeps an eye on your cat’s health as it happens. It’s like a FitBit
        and a security camera merged with a trash compactor, and then taught to care deeply about your cat’s digestive output. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

      <p>
        This thing does more than just spin the litter bowl and hide the mess. The AI camera rotates up to 180 degrees and records
        every visit so you can view clips or images in the PETKIT app. It uses facial recognition to identify individual cats and
        automatically captures photos of stool and clumps after each cleaning cycle. Then it analyzes things like color, consistency,
        and clump size for signs of constipation, diarrhea, or urinary issues — giving you early disease pre-screening indicators
        to share with your vet. You can check those captures against a health chart in the timeline, so every poop comes with
        context rather than mystery. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, it also handles the basics you actually signed up for: the Purobot Ultra scoops, seals waste in bags, packs
        them away, and refills them for you so you don’t have to think about scooping for maybe a couple of weeks. Advanced
        deodorization and safety sensors keep your home odor-controlled and your cat safe during operation. What started as
        “literally no one asked for this” ends up feeling like “wow… I *do* want to know if my cat’s bathroom habits suddenly
        look weird.” It makes the litter box feel like a health device rather than a garbage can, and because your cat can’t
        text you directly about constipation, this is the next best thing. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
