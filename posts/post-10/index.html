    <h1>An AI stroller that thinks it’s a Tesla.</h1>

      <p>
        Parenting is hard, so some startup somewhere asked, “What if the stroller could do more than just be pushed?”
        Enter Glüxkind, a Vancouver-based company building AI-powered strollers that aim to make every walk feel a little more
        assisted. At the top of their lineup is the Ella (and its newer flagship Rosa), a smart stroller that can help you
        climb hills, slow you down on descents, and generally turn sidewalks into something closer to a guided experience.
        It’s basically a stroller with a motor and a brain, which is an exciting sentence and also an alarming one.

      <p>
        Glüxkind calls the system “Advanced Parent Assist.” In practice, it combines powered push assistance, adaptive braking,
        and obstacle sensing so you can steer without feeling like you’re pushing a shopping cart uphill through time.
        It also includes features like Rock-My-Baby for gentle motion and white noise playback for nap support, because nothing
        says “modern parenting” like streaming ambience from your stroller. And yes, there’s an autonomous mode when the stroller
        is empty, which is exactly the kind of detail that makes you say “cool” and “wait” in the same breath.
      </p>

      <p>
        None of this comes cheap. Ella started around $3,300 and has often been sold out or backordered, with Rosa positioned as
        the premium version. If you’re a parent who regularly deals with hills, long walks, or one-handed stroller steering while
        carrying half your household, the assistance probably sounds amazing. If you’re not, it still raises an important question:
        are we building technology to help parents, or are we slowly turning every object in our lives into a small electric vehicle?
