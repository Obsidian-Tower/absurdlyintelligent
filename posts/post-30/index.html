      <p>
        We’ve officially reached the moment where your refrigerator is smarter than most of your exes.
        Samsung’s AI-powered Bespoke fridge with Family Hub can do things that sound like the plot of a
        weird home-automation sitcom. It doesn’t just chill vegetables; it listens to your voice, looks
        at what’s inside using computer vision, talks back, and even responds when you command it to open
        its door. No, really. You can say “open the fridge” out loud, and it may actually comply —
        forever ending the classic dispute of “who gets the first snack” with the cold, impartial logic
        of an appliance that definitely has opinions.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the heart of it is Samsung’s Family Hub: a touchscreen interface that combines meal planning,
        calendars, weather, and grocery lists with AI features that can recognize food items inside the
        fridge without you having to open the door. Thanks to integrated cameras and machine learning,
        your fridge can tell whether you’re low on milk, how long the leftovers have been hanging out,
        and likely judge your decision to buy those three different kinds of hot sauce. You can talk to it
        like a reluctant roommate: ask it what’s inside, tell it to suggest recipes, or — if you’re feeling
        dramatic — ask it why you’re opening the door at 2 a.m. for the third time this week.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fridge’s AI isn’t just a glorified grocery list. It’s designed to actually understand your food,
        your routines, and possibly your questionable dietary choices. It integrates with family calendars,
        lets users leave digital notes (because sticky notes don’t tweet), and can share grocery data with
        your other smart devices. In other words, it knows when you’re out of lettuce and when you’ve begun
        the week with leftover pizza again. If you want to see Samsung’s take on the future of smart food
        storage, you can check it out here:
