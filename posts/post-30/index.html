      <p>
        We’ve officially entered the era where your refrigerator expects conversation.
        Samsung’s AI-powered Bespoke fridge with Family Hub doesn’t just keep things cold —
        it listens, watches, and responds. You can literally tell it to open the door,
        ask what’s inside without touching a handle, and get recipe suggestions based on
        what it sees using built-in cameras and computer vision. At some point we decided
        the biggest problem in the kitchen was the physical act of opening a fridge,
        and Samsung stepped in to solve it with artificial intelligence.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the heart of it is Samsung’s Family Hub: a touchscreen interface that combines meal planning,
        calendars, weather, and grocery lists with AI features that can recognize food items inside the
        fridge without you having to open the door. Thanks to integrated cameras and machine learning,
        your fridge can tell whether you’re low on milk, how long the leftovers have been hanging out,
        and likely judge your decision to buy those three different kinds of hot sauce. You can talk to it
        like a reluctant roommate: ask it what’s inside, tell it to suggest recipes, or — if you’re feeling
        dramatic — ask it why you’re opening the door at 2 a.m. for the third time this week.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s designed to actually understand your food,
        your routines, and possibly your questionable dietary choices. It integrates with family calendars,
        lets users leave digital notes (because sticky notes don’t tweet), and can share grocery data with
        your other smart devices. In other words, it knows when you’re out of lettuce and when you’ve begun
        the week with leftover pizza again. If you want to see Samsung’s take on the future of smart food
        storage, you can check it out here:
