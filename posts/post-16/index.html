      <p>
        Somewhere between keeping content “fresh” and filling in the blanks, an AI working for an Australian travel company
        decided Tasmania needed another hot spring. It confidently introduced the world to the “Weldborough Hot Springs,”
        describing them as a peaceful, mineral-rich forest retreat favored by hikers and wellness seekers. The write-up
        sounded convincing. The images looked right. The destination, however, was entirely fictional.
      </p>

      <p>
        The article lived on the Tasmania Tours website long enough for tourists to believe it. People began calling local
        businesses and physically driving to Weldborough asking for directions to the springs. The local pub owner, confused
        but amused, started telling visitors that if they managed to find the hot springs, beers were on her. No one ever
        claimed the reward.
      </p>

      <p>
        What visitors actually encountered was Weldborough itself: a remote town, dense forest, and a river so cold that
        anyone entering it wears a wetsuit. The dramatic contrast between expectation and reality wasn’t subtle. The AI
        imagery promised steaming pools tucked into cliffs; the real landscape offered prospectors, trees, and exactly zero
        geothermal activity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The story spread quickly because it perfectly captured a new kind of mistake. AI didn’t just get a detail wrong —
        it invented an entire experience, complete with imagery, descriptions, and emotional framing. The company removed
        the content and apologized, but the lesson stuck. When AI is used to generate destinations at scale, it doesn’t
        always stop to check whether a place exists. In this case, it accidentally created Tasmania’s most popular hot
        spring that never was.
