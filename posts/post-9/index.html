      <p>
        Picking a scent used to be as simple as “do I like the smell?” Then the tech world said “hold my spritz bottle.”
        Meet <strong>NINU</strong>, the world’s first smart perfume — a little handheld device that holds
        three different fragrance bases and mixes them together on demand, controlled by an app on your phone. Instead of
        wandering a department store sniffing tiny paper strips, the app (and its AI enhancements) will tell you what you
        should smell like based on things like your mood, time of day, and even the weather outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside the gadget are three complementary scent cartridges. By adjusting how much of each base goes into the mix,
        you can create what NINU calls “over 100” different fragrances from a single bottle — kind of like having an
        entire perfume counter in your pocket. The companion app lets you choose presets (office? date night? fresh morning!)
        or manually blend things yourself if you’ve decided the world still needs *your* signature scent.
        It even learns from your preferences over time, which means your perfume can theoretically evolve as your life does.
      </p>

      <p>
        What’s funny about NINU isn’t that it mixes scents — it’s that it assumes choosing how you smell is a problem that needs
        optimization. Not “what do I like?” but “what should I smell like right now?” as decided by software. Work scent. Date scent.
        Afternoon errands scent. It’s the logical conclusion of a world where everything gets a mode. And sure, it’ll probably do a
        decent job — apps are great at producing reasonable answers. But there’s something quietly absurd about outsourcing even this
        last, irrational, human choice to an algorithm. At some point you’re not picking a fragrance anymore… you’re just complying
        with vibes-as-a-service.
