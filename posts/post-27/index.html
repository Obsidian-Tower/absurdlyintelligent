        Some people journal. Others meditate. Now you can simply open your laptop and let an algorithm
        evaluate your entire existence. <em>How Normal Am I?</em> is an interactive documentary that
        uses facial recognition AI to judge your beauty, age, gender, BMI, emotions, and more —
        then compares you to everyone who came before you. If you score a 6.5 in attractiveness,
        is that good? Don’t worry. The machine will tell you how you stack up.

        The experience feels playful at first, almost like a personality quiz,
        until you remember similar systems are already used in dating apps,
        insurance models, hiring software, and advertising. For an algorithm,
        “normal” has to be defined mathematically — which usually means
        “average.” And once average becomes the benchmark, anything above or below
        quietly turns into a deviation.

        The project has been viewed over 650,000 times and even won awards,
        which is impressive for something that essentially ranks your face
        against a database of strangers. It’s part satire, part warning,
        and part digital mirror. Because nothing says modern life quite like
        asking your webcam, “Am I normal?” and waiting for a percentage.
