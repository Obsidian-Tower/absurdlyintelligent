        1X’s Neo is a $20,000 humanoid robot designed to live in your house and gently wipe your countertops.
        It stands about 5'6", moves cautiously, and recently learned how to peel a Post-it note off a wall and read it.
        That may not sound revolutionary, but according to CEO Bernt Børnich, the real magic is Neo’s “World Model” —
        a system that lets the robot simulate outcomes before acting. In theory, that means Neo won’t crush your wine glass,
        flood your kitchen, or panic when faced with an unfamiliar washing machine. In practice, it may still take several
        minutes to complete a task you would finish in twelve seconds.

      <p>
        Meanwhile, in China, humanoid robots are doing kung fu on national television.
        During the Spring Festival Gala, dozens of Unitree robots punched, kicked, backflipped,
        breakdanced, and sprinted at nine miles per hour. While Neo carefully considers how to
        open your fridge without knocking over the orange juice, Chinese humanoids are executing
        synchronized martial arts routines like they’re auditioning for “Robots of the Shaolin.”
        And unlike boutique home assistants, Unitree plans to manufacture up to 20,000 robots this year.

        The contrast is fascinating. Neo represents the careful, domestic vision of robotics:
        slow, thoughtful, human-shaped helpers learning to live alongside us. The kung-fu robots
        represent scale, spectacle, and momentum — machines evolving at what appears to be
        breakneck speed. One robot waters plants. The other wields nunchucks. Both are signs that
        humanoid robotics is no longer theoretical. The only real question now is whether your
        future houseguest will politely ask where the dishwasher is… or challenge it to a sparring match.
