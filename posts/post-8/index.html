    <h1>A talking pet collar. Yes, like UP.</h1>

        Ever since Pixar’s <em>UP</em> dropped in 2009, humanity has been haunted by one question: “Why can’t my dog tell me what it wants?”
        The <strong>Shazam Band</strong> is here to confidently answer: “Because it would be chaos… but we’re doing it anyway.”
        It’s an AI-powered collar with speakers and sensors that lets you “have a conversation” with your pet — meaning you talk at your dog,
        and the collar plays a human voice response like your pet is finally participating in society. It’s either the greatest invention
        of our time or the beginning of a new era where your dog has opinions about your lifestyle choices.
      </p>

        It’s not just “talking,” either. The band also does tracking — if your pet wanders off, you can find them in the Shazam app using
        built-in GPS (depending on the model), and it can alert you if it thinks your pet is in danger or got left behind somewhere.
        Which is comforting… and also mildly hilarious, because it implies your dog might someday text you like:
        <strong>“I took a wrong turn. Please advise.”</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The big question is: does it actually work? Maybe. Sometimes. In demos it can feel magical, and other times it feels like you’re
        watching a chatbot cosplay as a golden retriever. But that’s kind of the product: “sentience augmentation,” or as normal people call it,
        “a vibes translator strapped to an animal.” The Shazam Band is up for pre-order in two versions: the full GPS-enabled model is
        <strong>$595</strong>, and a less fully-featured version is <strong>$495</strong>. Either way, you’re paying hundreds of dollars to let your
        pet speak in a human voice — which is exactly the kind of purchase you make right before saying, “no, I’m totally fine financially.”
