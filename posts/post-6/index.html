        Pet cameras have been around forever — the classic wall-mounted “is my cat alive?” rectangle. But at CES this week,
        a startup called <strong>FrontierX</strong> rolled out <strong>Vex</strong>, a tiny autonomous robot sphere dressed up like a cute little creature,
        whose entire job is to <strong>follow your pet around all day</strong> and film them. Not from the corner of a room. Not from the ceiling.
        From a low angle, right in the action — meaning you don’t just watch your cat… you experience life at floor level, like you’re finally
        earning their respect (you won’t).
      </p>

      <!-- IMAGE 2 PLACEHOLDER -->

      <p>
        The twist is the AI part: Vex doesn’t just record hours of “cat sits near window.” It’s supposed to take all that footage and
        <strong>auto-edit daily highlights</strong> into short, shareable clips — a little “story” of your pet’s day without you scrubbing through timelines
        like a security guard reviewing a heist. The idea is genuinely great… assuming the AI can figure out the difference between “adorable moment”
        and “seven straight minutes of cat licking itself.” FrontierX hasn’t shown much real edited output yet, which is the kind of detail
        that matters when the whole product is “trust us, the edit will be good.”
      </p>

      <p>
        And because the future never releases just one weird orb, FrontierX also showed <strong>Aura</strong>, basically the human version:
        a larger companion bot with a screen face that can follow you around, read your body language, and chat using LLM-powered conversation.
        Same concept, different target: Vex is “I followed your cat and made a video,” and Aura is “I followed you and learned your vibe.”
        Both are still in development, preorders are supposedly coming within about <strong>six months</strong>, and pricing hasn’t been announced —
        which is very on-brand for CES: big promise now, details later. Either way, we’ve officially entered a new category of consumer tech:
        not cameras that watch you… but little robots that actively tail you around your own home like an employee. A clip of Aura <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gRhysbrBjsg" target="_blank" style="color:var(--accent); text-decoration:none;">
